This error is due to your CentOS 7 system or Python environment not trusting the SSL certificates required to connect to https://huggingface.co.

✅ Solution: Install CA Certificates

You need to ensure that your system has the correct Certificate Authority (CA) bundle installed and trusted.

Step 1: Install CA certificates

sudo yum install ca-certificates -y
sudo update-ca-trust force-enable
sudo update-ca-trust extract


---

✅ Step 2: Rebuild SSL in your virtual environment

Sometimes, Python built on old systems misses modern CA roots. You may need to reinstall certifi:

/myenv/bin/pip install --upgrade certifi

Optionally, point Python explicitly to the correct cert bundle:

export SSL_CERT_FILE=$(python -m certifi)

You can also add this to your ~/.bashrc:

echo 'export SSL_CERT_FILE=$(python -m certifi)' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc


---

✅ Step 3: Test connection

Try a simple HTTPS test:

curl https://huggingface.co

If it still gives a cert error, your system's root CA is broken or outdated. Try this instead:

yum update -y nss openssl


---

✅ Step 4: Re-run your script

Once certs are in place:

export HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
./start.sh

Let me know if you want to disable SSL verification as a last resort (not recommended for production), or if you want to download the model manually and load it from a local directory to avoid internet issues entirely.
