You're on CentOS 7, which comes with OpenSSL 1.0.2k, but urllib3 v2+ and other modern tools require OpenSSL ≥ 1.1.1 or even 3.x. Upgrading OpenSSL on CentOS 7 is possible but requires care to avoid breaking system packages.

Option 1: Install a newer OpenSSL in parallel (safe option)

1. Install development tools and dependencies:

yum groupinstall -y "Development Tools"
yum install -y gcc perl-core zlib-devel

2. Download and compile OpenSSL (1.1.1 or 3.x):

cd /usr/local/src
curl -O https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1w.tar.gz
tar xvf openssl-1.1.1w.tar.gz
cd openssl-1.1.1w
./config --prefix=/usr/local/openssl --openssldir=/usr/local/openssl shared zlib
make -j$(nproc)
make install

3. Update environment to use the new OpenSSL:

export PATH=/usr/local/openssl/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/openssl/lib
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/openssl/lib/pkgconfig

To make it permanent, add these to ~/.bashrc or /etc/profile.d/openssl.sh.

4. Verify:

openssl version

Should show: OpenSSL 1.1.1w

Option 2: Use a newer Python compiled with newer OpenSSL (recommended for Python apps)

If your system Python links to old OpenSSL, consider installing Python from source with a new OpenSSL version. I can walk you through that as well if needed.
