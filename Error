This confirms that your CentOS 7 system does not have the necessary CA certificates to verify SSL certificates, which is causing the Hugging Face login and model/tokenizer loading to fail.

Fix SSL Certificate Issue on CentOS 7

Run the following steps:


---

1. Install or update CA certificates

yum install -y ca-certificates
update-ca-trust force-enable
update-ca-trust extract


---

2. Verify that certifi is updated in your virtualenv

pip install --upgrade certifi


---

3. Set the correct certificate path (one-time test):

export SSL_CERT_FILE=$(python -m certifi)

If this works, make it permanent:

echo 'export SSL_CERT_FILE=$(python -m certifi)' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc


---

4. Test with curl again

curl https://huggingface.co

If it no longer throws the SSL error, you're good.


---

5. Restart your app

./start.sh

Let me know what happens â€” if the SSL issue is resolved, your model should load fine.
