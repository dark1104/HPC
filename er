Great — that means OpenSSL 1.1.1w is now installed and detected correctly in your shell!

However, Python still needs to be recompiled (or at least re-linked) to use this newer OpenSSL version. The Python ssl module is still pointing to the older system OpenSSL (1.0.2k), which is causing the urllib3 and requests SSL errors.

To fix this, you need to:

1. Rebuild Python from source and link it to OpenSSL 1.1.1w

Here’s how:

cd /usr/local/src
curl -O https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.19/Python-3.9.19.tgz
tar xzf Python-3.9.19.tgz
cd Python-3.9.19
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/python3.9 --with-openssl=/usr/local/openssl
make -j$(nproc)
make install

2. Create a new virtual environment using the new Python

/usr/local/python3.9/bin/python3 -m venv /root/ollama/newenv
source /root/ollama/newenv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install requests

Then test again:

python -c "import requests; print(requests.get('https://huggingface.co').status_code)"


---

This ensures your Python environment uses OpenSSL 1.1.1w, solving the certificate and urllib3 issues.

Let me know if you'd like a one-liner for installing Python with OpenSSL, or help cleaning up the old environment.

This confirms the issue: your Python environment is still using a version of Python compiled against OpenSSL 1.0.2k, not the newer OpenSSL 1.1.1w you installed.

Even though you built OpenSSL 1.1.1w, your Python interpreter wasn’t compiled to use it, so the ssl module still links to the old system OpenSSL.


---

To fix this, here's what you need to do step by step:

1. Recompile Python 3.9.19 and explicitly link it to OpenSSL 1.1.1w

From inside the Python-3.9.19 source folder:

# Assuming OpenSSL 1.1.1w is installed at /usr/local/openssl
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/python3.9.19 --with-openssl=/usr/local/openssl
make -j$(nproc)
make altinstall

> Use make altinstall instead of make install to avoid overwriting the system Python.



2. Verify Python is using the right OpenSSL

/usr/local/python3.9.19/bin/python3.9 -m ssl

The output should show:

OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.1.1w ...

3. Create a new virtual environment with the new Python build

/usr/local/python3.9.19/bin/python3.9 -m venv ~/newenv
source ~/newenv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install requests

Then test again:

python -c "import requests; print(requests.get('https://huggingface.co').status_code)"

You should get 200 without verify=False.
